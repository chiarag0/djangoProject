# TasteBuds
TasteBuds is a recipe sharing website in Django where users can share and discover new recipes. 

The project is linked to a database that stores the users’ data and the recipes. 

Users can search for recipes and use the website as a host, but it is preferable to register to unlock features such as recipe creation and recipe favoriting. The search function is implemented as a search by title, while adding a recipe to a favourite list is as simple as clicking on a button. Adding an element to your favourites displays a message, and so does removing it. Every user can create a new recipe, specifying a category, which is the difficulty of the recipe related to cooking skills, an arbitrary number of ingredients (which are made up of a name and a quantity, and have their own table in the database) and an arbitrary number of instruction steps. Obviously, a user can only decide to delete a recipe he created, but a superuser can delete every recipe on the website. 

Users can interact with the website thanks to a simple, accessible**, orange and white interface with intuitive buttons and links. The homepage displays a prototype of a logo made with fontspace.com’s free downloads of legally licensed fonts, and the complete list of recipes available on TasteBuds.

The website was deployed with Railway and can be found at taste-buds.up.railway.app .
